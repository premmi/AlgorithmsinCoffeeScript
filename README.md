========================
Implementation of following algorithms in CoffeeScript:

1. Greedy Algorithm - Optimal scheduling of jobs based on two differenct approaches: 
   (a) increasing order of diff between job priority and job duration
   (b) increasing order of ratio between job priority and job duration

2. Prim's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree given vertices and the edge cost involved in connecting the vertices
